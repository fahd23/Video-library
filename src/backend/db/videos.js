      "India entered the first T20I match of the series against Australia with a point to prove and did exactly that as they proceeded to defeat the hosts by 11 runs. Coming in to bat first, KL Rahul was the only one who got things going for India with a fantastic inning of 51 runs. He was ably supported by Ravindra Jadeja, whose last-moment blitzkrieg took India to a respectable score of 161 for seven. Australian came in to bat, and, D Arcy Short skipper Aaron Finch gave a bright start. The pair scored 30 runs each but failed to convert it into a big score as Australia lost the match by 11 runs. Even Moises Henriques 30-run cameo couldn't save them. For India, Yuzvendra Chahal and T Natarajan had dream spells as they took three important wickets each.",
